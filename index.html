                    <p>Born in 1596, René Descartes was a 17th-century French philosopher broadly recognized for his contributions to mathematics and science. His works are ubiquitous with [western science?] with well-known works and discoveries including: </p>

                    <h3>Mind-Body Dualism</h3>
                    <p>Descartes was particularly well known for his theory of mind and body: mind-body dualism. This was a metaphysical theory about how the mind and body should be thought about logically, asserting that the mind and body were two distinct entitites which work together, with the body being material in nature and the mind being an immaterial substance. The mind was of course capable of thought, and was not physically extended (able to take up space), while the body is. He defends this mind-body distinction further, stating that the body is divisible into parts, while the mind is not.(citation here) This will become important later.</p>

                    <h2>Strengths of Dualism</h2>
                    <p>While they get a lot of flak these days, Descartes' ideas about the relationship between body and mind were very impactful in their time. Dualism was a departure from the dominant and restrictive Orthodox Christian ideologies of the time, which viewed the mind and body as a unified extension of the soul. With this, practices like dissection of the human body were very rare, since it was thought that bodies needed to be preserved in order to go to heaven. Additionally, it was believed that disease and illness were attributable to things like moral wrongdoing; modern biomedical explanations were not even considered. (Mehta 203).</p>
                    <p>By separating the nonmaterial (mind and/or soul) from the material, Descartes' new theory laid the groudwork for modern biomedical thought. Dissection of bodies became much more common, leading to huge advancements in fields like anatomy and physiology (Mehta 203). This logical new way of viewing the body mechanistically, as biological system of parts, equipped scientists and doctors with the tools to understand and treat basic diseases and biological dysfunctions. In many ways, dualism was the introduction of the scientific method to Western medicine.</p>

                    <h3>Case Study: Hysteria and Psychosomatic Conditions</h3>
                    <p>
                        In her 2004 book, <em>Psychosomatic: Feminism and the Neurological Body</em>, Elizabeth A. Wilson explores limitations of mind-body dualism using discussion of conversion hysteria in the 19th century. This is a psychological condition that involves manifestations of physical symptons, thus it is <strong>psychosomatic</strong> in nature. People diagnosed with conversion hysteria could manifest physical symptoms as extreme as blindness, paralysis, tics, and amnesia. In many documented cases, these physical symptoms would resolve when the psychological roots of their conditions were addressed, typically through talk therapy or psychoanalysis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wilson used this example to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of different explanatory models. On biomedical accounts of psychosomatic conditions, she writes: “Although the relations between neurology and psychology are unanimously declared to be complex, the exact nature of the interrelating components has been less carefully examined” (Wilson 16). This criticism of biological reductionism is still relevant today, over 20 years later. The ubiquity and clinical relevance of fields like neuroscience and psychiatry have led to reductionistic narratives that rely on cherry-picked neurotransmitters to explain various behaviors and conditions. This can be seen in Wilson's discussion of ideas brought up in Peter Kramer's 1993 book <em>Listening to Prozac</em>, where Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) drugs and their clinical use are discussed. The clear effect of these drugs has led to Kramer and other psychiatrists attributing traumatic life events effects on patients psyche to serotonin pathways in the brain. While it is very difficult to say definitively whether or not this theory is correct, it  relies on highly reductionistic assumptions about the mechanistic connections between the brain and the mind and self.

                    <h1>More On Biomedical Reductionism</h1>
                    <p>
                        Large assertions like this are hardly uncommon in psychiatry and neuroscience—a phenomenon that can be seen as a relic of Descartes' ideas. A modern response to the restrictive nature of mind-body dualism involves extending the systems-level thinking to the mind, by centralizing the mind and self inside the brain. Francisco Ortega and Fernando Vidal go into great detail about this in their work on the <a href="">Cerebral Subject</a>.

                        Fields like neuroscience and psychiatry attempt to demystify the mind through mechanistic explanations of the brain, but often fall short and overatttribute the impact of certain mechanisms on the outputs of the system.

                            In this paper, Ortega and Vidal discuss the cultural phenonmenon of mapping and situating the self almost entirely inside one's brain. Using the term 'Cerebral Subject', they consider the implications of such a reductionist belief system. Socially, groups of 'bioidentities' and various practices using the neuro- prefix have emerged. Personhood and identity are increasingly discussed using biomedical and diagnostic terms, with people seeing the brain and the self as one in the same.

                            In chapter 4 of <em>Picturing Personhood</em>, a book about the societal impact of brain-scanning technology, Joseph Dumit discusses the use of these images as evidence in court. He brings up the trial of John Hinckley, the man who shot President Ronald Reagan in 1981, where images of Hinckely's brain were shown by his defense attorney to suggest that he shot the president due to condition of his brain. The intent of the attorney was similar to that of an insanity plea, attempting to get a lighter sentence for his client by reducing the state of his mind to colors and dimensions of a brain scan. The judge on the case fought hard to prohibit the use of these scans as evidence, as he knew the power they could hold. Brain images can be seen as the pinnacle of biomedical reductionism of the mind, since they seemingly provide objective evidence of a condition of the brain, and therefore the mind. Further, a brightly colored image of a brain scan seems to communicate a great deal of information to the layman, as if the condition of the brain were self-evident. In reality, these are 'expert images', which require years of experience and a trained eye to actually extract any meaningful information about the brain from, much less information about the subject's mind.

                            In chapter 3 of her book <em>Living on the Spectrum: Autism and Youth in Community</em>, Elizabeth Fein talks about a particularly controversial conceptual model for neurotypical people to understand autistic children. This model insists that these children should be seen as 'Innocent Machines', an assertion that their different brains mean that they are morally neutral. One of the many problems with this model is that it strips these children of any human autonomy, essentially portraying autistic people as robots. This represents another case of overfitting the systems-level thinking in our understanding of human minds, an extrapolation of Cartesian logic onto the minds autistic children.

                        <h3>Adult Neurogenesis</h3>
                        <p>
                            This paper by Beatrix P. Rubin covers a recent development in the field of neuroscience: that the growth of new neurons in adults is possible. This challenges existing beliefs surrounding the supposed fixed nature of the adult brain. It showcases an interesting downside of biological reductivism, particularly in the way that it contributes to self-limiting beliefs. Ideas about the brain's development as they relate to the mind and self are extremely pervasive, and set our expectation in many ways. Figures and timelines about brain development and decline become self-fulfilling prophecies, and their cultural impact should not be underestimated. For example, if it came out that the brain was essentially finished developing at 20 instead of 25, what differences would we see in adolescent behavior? Likewise, if there wasn't a common understanding that cognition tends to decline around age 60, and this number was instead pushed to 70 or 80, what differences would we see in our elederly populations?
